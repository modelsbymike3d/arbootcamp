Welcome to AR Bootcamp! If you want to learn how to create awesome augmented reality filters, you've come to the right place!

# How it works

Our ultimate goal is to have lessons for all the major AR platforms. Find the platform you're interested in learning, or you can use the search bar to look for whatever your heart desires. Starting out our focus is on Lens Studio by Snapchat, but we'll be expanding to Facebook and Instagrams Spark AR and possibly webAR platforms such as Zappar and 8th Wall.

# FAQs

## How can I help?
If you are an AR creator, you can contribute lessons! The source code for the site is [available on Github](https://github.com/modelsbymike3d/arbootcamp) and all lessons are written as markdown. If you need any help, you can create an issue asking for help and we'll get in touch.

## How much does it cost?
It's all free. No subscriptions, nothing.

## Can I learn VR here?
At the moment no. I don't have any experience creating VR, but if anyone else does, feel free to contribute!
