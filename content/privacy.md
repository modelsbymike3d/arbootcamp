We don't really have a privacy policy because we don't track you all that much. We do use [Plausible](https://plausible.io) for website analytics, but it is cookie-free and privacy focused so we only collect basic usage statistics.

If you sign up for the newsletter, we do not sell nor share your personal information (in this case, your email address). We use a double opt-in process and provide an unsubscribe link in every email so you can unsubscribe at any time.
